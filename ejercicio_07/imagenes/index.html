    <h1>Tasha Tudor</h1>
    <h2>Vida</h2>
    <p>Tasha Tudor was born in Boston, Massachusetts as Starling Burgess, the daughter of
     naval architect W. Starling Burgess, known as "the Skipper" and noted portrait painter Rosamund Tudor. At birth, she was named after her father, but he was an admirer of the War and Peace character Natasha, and his daughter was soon re-christened Natasha. The name was later shortened to Tasha.</p>
    <p><img src="./imagenes/62c0b2ee3f23c3adcfdd50e79af5f003.jpg" alt="tasha"> When socializing with her mother's friends, Tudor was usually introduced as "Rosamund Tudor's daughter, Tasha", leading others to believe that her last name was Tudor. Liking the sound of it, she adopted the name and eventually changed her surname legally following her second divorce. She married Thomas <a href="https://www.tashatudorandfamily.com/inspiration/homesteading"> in 1938 in Redding, Connecticut.</a> Tasha and Thomas McCready purchased a large old farm in Webster, New Hampshire, where four children, Bethany, Seth, Thomas, and Efner, were raised. Her first story, Pumpkin Moonshine, was published in 1938, as a gift for a young niece of her husband. They were divorced in 1961, and her children legally changed their names from McCready to Tudor. A later marriage, to Allan John Woods, lasted only a brief time.</p>
    <h2>Muerte</h2>
    <p>Tasha Tudor died on June 18, 2008 in Marlboro, Vermont. Her estate, valued at over $2 million, was contested by the three children she disinherited. According to the Daily Telegraph: "Her will, written in 2001, left the bulk of the estate to Seth Tudor, 67, and his son Winslow. It left only $1,000 each to her two daughters, Bethany Tudor, 69, and Efner Tudor Holmes, and a piece of antique furniture to younger son Thomas Tudor, 64, because of their 'estrangement' from her." However, according to Brattleboro Probate Court documents, over Tasha Tudor's lifetime, she gave her son Thomas Tudor a half share in her home in Marlboro, Vermont, and over $2 million in art work and other gifts, with a similar lifetime disposition to her two daughters.</p>
